Frontend Architecture
    Collection of practices, process & tools that aims to improve/upgrade your application code
    Helps in creating productive, scalable & sustainable worklfow
    It sets the standard to developers for writing code, reflecting best practices, documentation, SOP & achieving quality product.

    4 aspects of FE Architecture
        - Component-based arch
        - State management
        - Data flow & management
        - Bundling/Automation process

    Benefits of frontend architecture
        - Modularity
        - Separation of concern
        - Easily scalable
        - Faster development & productivity
        - Targeted testing
        - Easy to maintain & reuse components

    Best practices of frontend architecture
        - optimize design-to-development handoff
            # detailed design document inclued wireframes, style guides
            # use of collaborative tool such as figma
            # involve developers in ux design process & take their feedback
            # conduct regular design review 
            # launch & evaluate design post handoff
        - make use of CSS frameworks such as Tailwind/Material-UI components for consistent UX
        - focus on component based arch, 
        - proper state management
        - data arch pattern & component design pattern 
        - make use of bundler to automate the process
        - Embrace modularization : ES6Module
        - leverage component-base arch : React/Angular
        - Optimize performance : Caching mechanism, lazy loading
        - Reusable component : stateless/pure component
        - Focus on functional programming : React functional components
        - Implement Microfront for domain-wise : Microfrontend arch
        - Refactor code, address technical debt
        - Data flow & app security
